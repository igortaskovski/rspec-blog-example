# rspec blog example

Rails blog application to show example code for my [series](https://schneid.io/blog/writing-tests-for-rails-introduction) on writing tests on rspec. Initial commit is a basic Rails blog application derived from the Rails [Getting Started tutorial](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html). Second commit is a basic user/password authentication system. Subsequent commits are example code corresponding with blog posts.
